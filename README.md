History -
=======
Hi I am Sanjoy Dey. I love to create web applications. After enjoying couple of MVC frameworks and nearly 1 years of gained knowledge by creating small MVC, I started creating Cygnite Framework around 2012. Cygnite Framework will give you creative experience with expressive performance and user friendly architecture to reduce your development time.

Cygnite is currently in development stage (Alpha 1.0) and contributions to Cygnite development would be highly appreciated.

Hope you enjoy the simplicity of Cygnite Framework.
